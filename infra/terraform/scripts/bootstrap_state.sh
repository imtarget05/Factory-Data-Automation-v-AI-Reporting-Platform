# Factory-Data-Automation-v-AI-Reporting-Platform — Terraform remote state
# foundation (B1).
#
# SCOPE, precisely: this creates ONLY the control-plane foundation needed for
# `terraform init` to reach remote state. It creates NO application or compute
# resource — no AKS cluster, no node pool, no ACR, no Key Vault, no networking.
#
# WHY A REPO-OWNED FOUNDATION, NOT A SHARED ONE: until Phase 2 this Terraform
# root had NO backend block at all. The stated reason for omitting it — that a
# placeholder would let local state files be mistaken for durable state — was
# right, but omitting the block did not achieve that: `terraform init` succeeded
# and wrote state to a laptop `.tfstate`. The fix is a MANDATORY per-environment
# backend, not an absent one. The portfolio pattern (partial backend + Entra
# auth + disabled shared key) is worth copying; another project's storage
# account is not. Isolation is enforced by tests/probe_backend_isolation.py.
#
# COST: a Storage Account is not free. It bills a small amount per day for
# capacity and transactions. It is also NOT a compute-quota consumer — it does
# not touch the 10-vCPU regional ceiling. It is deliberately PERMANENT: it holds
# canonical Terraform state, so transient application teardown must never
# destroy it.
#
# NETWORK: public network access stays ENABLED, because a GitHub-hosted runner
# has no stable outbound IP to allow-list. This is a documented trade-off, not
# an oversight:
#     PUBLIC_NETWORK_REACHABLE + ENTRA_AUTH_REQUIRED + SHARED_KEY_DISABLED
# The control that matters is that SharedKey authorisation is refused
# server-side, so there is no key to leak. A private endpoint with an
# Azure-hosted runner is the hardened option if that is ever needed.
#
# IDEMPOTENT: safe to re-run. Every step reads back before it creates.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/bootstrap_state.sh --dry-run          # intent, zero mutation
#   ALLOW_AZURE_MUTATION=1 ./scripts/bootstrap_state.sh

This account CAN incur small ongoing storage cost. It is NOT compute quota.
