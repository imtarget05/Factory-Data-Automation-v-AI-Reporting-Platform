"""Backend isolation + secretless-state probe for Factory-Data-Automation-v-AI-Reporting-Platform.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS: until Phase 2 this Terraform root had NO backend block at
all. That is worse than a wrong backend block, because `terraform init` SUCCEEDED
and wrote state to a laptop `.tfstate` that no other operator could read — a
silent failure, and one that every static check stayed green through.

Isolation has to be a CONTROL, not a habit, or the next refactor reintroduces
exactly this.

RULES
  S1  no client_secret / ARM_CLIENT_SECRET in the backend path
  S2  no storage account key or SAS token in any backend config
  S3  shared-key auth is not required: state is Entra/RBAC only
  S4  every environment's state key is distinct
  S5  this repo references NO other portfolio project's state resources
  S6  no cross-project state key appears in committed config
  S7  `use_oidc` is NOT hardcoded — a static value forces the GitHub Actions
      OIDC path (ACTIONS_ID_TOKEN_REQUEST_TOKEN) and breaks a local `az login`
      init. CI supplies ARM_* instead.
  S8  backend config is PARTIAL and a missing backend.hcl makes `terraform init`
      FAIL rather than silently fall back to local state. Proved by running the
      init harness, not by grepping for the word "backend".

Usage: python3 tests/probe_backend_isolation.py
Exit:  0 = clean AND every rule bit for its intended reason.
        1 = a violation, or a rule that failed to bite.

    WHY THIS IS NOT A GREP: the failure mode being prevented is silent. A

    state, and then `terraform plan`/`apply` write state to a laptop that no
    other operator can read — with every other rule still green, because the
    rules describe committed files, not runtime behaviour.

    The harness runs init in a throwaway copy of the root with the backend config
    REMOVED, and requires it to exit non-zero. It never contacts Azure: the
    backend values point at a non-resolvable name, so a fallback to local state
    is exactly what a passing run would reveal.
