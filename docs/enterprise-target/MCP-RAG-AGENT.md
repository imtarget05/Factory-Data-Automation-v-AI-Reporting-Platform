# MCP · RAG · AI AGENT — Factory-Data-Automation-v-AI-Reporting-Platform

> Enterprise Target. MCP + RAG + AI Agent appear in **all three** repos, but with **different roles**. See [`ROADMAP.md`](./ROADMAP.md) and [`AI-PRODUCTION-GATE.md`](./AI-PRODUCTION-GATE.md).

## Division of responsibility

```text
RAG        = retrieve the right knowledge
AI Agent   = decide the next step and coordinate work
MCP        = standardize how Agent/LLM reaches tools, data and external systems
```

## Agent must never bypass security

```text
Agent → Typed Intent → Schema Validation → RBAC / Tenant Check
      → Risk Check → HITL if required → Deterministic Tool
```

## Role by repository

| Repo | RAG | AI Agent | MCP |
|---|---|---|---|
| **MAIA** | ⭐ Core | ⭐ Core | ⭐ Core |
| **Helpdesk** | ⭐ Core (ITIL / runbook) | ⭐ Core (support workflow) | ⭐ Core (tool integration) |
| **Factory** | 🟡 Supporting | 🟡 Supporting (investigation / reporting) | ⭐ Core (integration layer) |

**`MCP ≠ Agent`.** MCP is a *protocol* for exposing resources / prompts / tools. The **Agent** decides *when* a tool is needed; **MCP** defines *how* it is called; **RAG** supplies knowledge for reasoning.

## This repository — Factory-Data-Automation-v-AI-Reporting-Platform

**Identity: Deterministic Data Platform + MCP-connected AI Investigation Agent.**

Do **not** turn Factory into a RAG chatbot. It stays an industrial data platform:

```text
ERP / CSV / IoT → Blob RAW → Event Grid → Service Bus → ETL Worker
                → Quarantine | Silver → Gold → KPI / Mart
                → Deterministic Gate → AI Analysis → Investigation Agent → MCP
```

### RAG (supporting)

RAG is **not** a quality gate. It only supports SOP · machine manuals · data dictionary · schema definitions · production procedures · maintenance docs · incident history · quality policies.
Example: `KPI anomaly → retrieve machine manual + SOP + previous incident → AI explains possible cause`.
RAG/LLM must **never** decide `GOOD / WARNING / CRITICAL` — the quality gate stays deterministic.

### Agent (supporting — investigation / reporting only)

**May do:** anomaly investigation · root-cause hypothesis · report composition · data exploration · operator recommendation.
**May NOT do:** data-quality authority · automatic production control · automatic machine shutdown.
Flow: `Quality Gate → anomaly? → Investigation Agent → query KPI → inspect batch → retrieve SOP → compare historical runs → generate explanation`.

### MCP (core — integration layer)

```text
factory-mcp/
├── kpi-server      ├── batch-server
├── quality-server  ├── lineage-server
├── document-server └── job-server
```

Tools: `kpi.get`, `kpi.compare`, `batch.get_manifest`, `batch.get_quarantine_summary`, `quality.get_gate_result`, `quality.get_failed_checks`, `lineage.get_source`, `lineage.get_artifacts`, `docs.search`, `job.status`.
Write tool `job.reprocess` must be: `typed request → authorization → idempotency key → Service Bus`. The Agent must never call the ETL function directly.

### Factory demonstrates

> Deterministic Data Platform + MCP-connected AI Investigation Agent.

### Example end-to-end request

> Operator: "Why is the defect rate on line A up?"

```text
Agent
  → MCP kpi.compare
  → MCP batch.get_manifest
  → MCP quality.get_failed_checks
  → RAG: relevant SOP / manual
  → Agent → root-cause hypotheses → evidence → report
```

Status `CRITICAL` is decided **before** the Agent, by the deterministic quality gate.

## PHASE 6E — RAG Production Hardening

MAIA **mandatory**. Helpdesk applies to its KB. Factory applies to docs/SOP only.

**Gate:**
```text
[ ] retrieval ACL
[ ] tenant isolation
[ ] hybrid actually executes
[ ] reranker actually executes
[ ] empty retrieval behavior
[ ] no-answer behavior
[ ] chunk provenance
[ ] source identity
[ ] citation mapping
[ ] Recall@K
[ ] Precision@K
[ ] MRR
[ ] NDCG
[ ] retrieval regression gate
```

## PHASE 6F — MCP Tool Platform

```text
Implement PHASE 6F — MCP TOOL PLATFORM.

Do NOT use MCP merely as a wrapper around arbitrary code execution.

For each project inventory existing deterministic business capabilities and
expose only appropriate capabilities through typed MCP tools/resources.

MAIA:     knowledge / search / document / safe-action MCP.
Helpdesk: ticket / asset / knowledge / directory / approved-automation MCP.
Factory:  KPI / batch / quality / lineage / document / job MCP.

Every MCP tool must have:
  name
  version
  input schema
  output schema
  authorization policy
  tenant policy
  timeout
  retry classification
  side-effect classification
  idempotency semantics
  audit contract

Separate READ and WRITE tools.

High-risk write tools must never be directly executable by an LLM without
the existing deterministic authorization/HITL layer.

Treat every MCP response as untrusted external data when returning it to an
agent. Add indirect prompt-injection tests.

Instrument every call with: request_id, trace_id, agent_run_id, tool_call_id.

Add MCP negative controls for:
  unauthorized caller
  wrong tenant
  schema violation
  server timeout
  server unavailable
  malicious tool output
  duplicate write
  unsupported tool version.

No project may depend on another project's MCP server for its core
availability. Finish one repository before starting the next.
```

## PHASE 6G — Agent + RAG + MCP End-to-End

The strongest gate. Prove the **complete business workflow**, not each subsystem alone.

```text
MAIA:     question → agent → RAG → MCP → reasoning → SSE → citation
Helpdesk: ticket → RAG → agent → MCP read tools → proposal → HITL → queue → executor
Factory:  anomaly → deterministic gate → agent → MCP → RAG SOP → evidence-backed report
```

```text
Execute PHASE 6G — AGENT + RAG + MCP END-TO-END VALIDATION.

The purpose is not to prove each subsystem independently. Prove the complete
business workflow.

MAIA:
  authenticated tenant request
  → agent
  → tenant-filtered retrieval
  → MCP tool
  → grounded response
  → true SSE
  → citations.

Helpdesk:
  ticket
  → runbook retrieval
  → MCP investigation
  → typed proposal
  → deterministic authorization
  → HITL
  → queued execution
  → post-check
  → audit.

Factory:
  quality anomaly
  → deterministic quality decision
  → MCP evidence collection
  → RAG SOP/manual retrieval
  → investigation agent
  → structured report.

Inject failures at each boundary. Required failures:
  RAG unavailable
  MCP unavailable
  tool timeout
  LLM provider unavailable
  invalid tool output
  prompt injection in tool output
  agent max-step reached
  duplicate write delivery.

The system must fail predictably without bypassing authorization or
fabricating evidence.

Only after all three workflows pass positive and negative E2E tests may
Phase 6G be marked VERIFIED.
```
